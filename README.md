# Eamon-Earl-OpsLevel-application
Simple to-do list

Notes: I took about an hour and 45 minutes to complete and test this, althought I wasn't exactly barreling through at top speed. I documented relevant invariants and assumptions at the top of each module, and added a future change at the top of the controller method, which I only acknowledged after discovering missed functionality during testing and I didn't want to go too far over the time to fix it, but all the important functionality is still present; it would've mainly been a helpful change for modifiability and ease of use / code readability in the future, good thing it's just a test project (but I always like to acknowledge this stuff). My apologies for not committing consistently to the repo throughout, I just got a little carried away. Let me know if you have any questions and I really appreciate you all taking the time to consider me for this position.
